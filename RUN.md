NEXT STEPS:
1) run on redbox
   1000, 0.1771
   2000, 0.1761
2) research
   -> bring in bayesian cross entropy etc
   -> confusion matrix to see evolution over training
   -> caffe mnist and imagenet examples to quickly test things out
   and use undersampling as well
3) logistic regression confidence intervals
   -> bit.ly/1oawXcH
   -> bit.ly/1oawVkS
   ->
4) final product merge test set into training set!!
